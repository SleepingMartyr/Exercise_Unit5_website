        <h1>Erzsébet Báthory</h1>
        
        <p><strong>Erzsébet Báthory</strong>, also known as <strong>the Bloody Countess</strong>, was a Hungarian noblewoman born in Nyírbátor, Hungary, in 1560. She came from one of the most powerful families in the region, with connections to kings and high-ranking officials. She married Count Ferenc Nádasdy, with whom she had several children, and they lived in Csejte Castle (present-day Slovakia).</p>
        <p>After her husband's death, rumors about her cruelty began to spread. She was accused of torturing and murdering hundreds of young servants, and later daughters of the nobility, allegedly to preserve her youth by bathing in their blood. These tales turned her into a legendary figure and associated her with the myth of vampirism.</p>
        <p>In 1610, she was arrested following an investigation ordered by King Matthias II. Although she was never formally tried, her accomplices were executed, and she was sentenced to lifelong confinement in her castle, where she died in 1614.</p>
        <p>While many modern historians believe some of the accusations may have been exaggerated or politically motivated, Erzsébet Báthory is still remembered as one of the most infamous killers in European history and a source of inspiration for horror literature and film.</p>
